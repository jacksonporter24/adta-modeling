RELATIONSHIPS
One to one
Users to authors
Because an author is a user
One to many
Recipe to ingredients
Because recipes have more than one ingredient
Users to posts
Because users can post more than once, but one post can’t have multiple users. 
Users to comments
Because users can comment, but comments do not have more than one user. 

Posts to comments
Because one post can have multiple comments, but one comment cannot be on multiple posts. 
Recipes to comments
See above
Shopping list to ingredients
One shopping list can have more than one ingredient, but an ingredient is never simultaneously in multiple shopping lists. 
Recipe to ratings
One recipe has multiple ratings. But one rating is not applied multiple times to the same recipe (by a single user). 
User to ratings
A user can rate recipes, but no one can rate a user. 
User to favorites. 
One user can have multiple favorites, but it is impossible for a favorite to contain a user. 
Many to many
Recipe to ingredients
Because one recipe has multiple ingredients, but one ingredient cannot contain multiple recipes within itself. 
Recipes to authors
Recipes can have multiple authors, and an author can be attached to multiple recipes.
